Wollensak.Wollensak was an American manufacturer of audio-visual products located in Rochester New York .
At the height of their popularity in the 1950s and 1960s , many brands of movie cameras came with a Wollensak Velostigmat lens .
Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorders were prized for their robust construction and value .
In the 1960s , Wollensak was the choice tape recorder for amateur home , school , and office uses .
They were produced in both stereo and mono designs .. The firm was founded in 1899 by Andrew Wollensak to produce camera shutters .
At its peak in the 1950s , it employed over a thousand people .
The company had several owners , including Revere Camera Company and 3M Company .
Wollensak ceased operation in 1972 .. Wollensak began making camera lenses in 1902 .
The company also produced camera shutters for large format cameras .
They made shutters such as the Betax , Alphax , Optimo and , for the Graflex Corporation , Rapax .. The Betax shutters were patented in 1912 and remain popular for large format photographers today .
Betax shutters are made in different sizes from size # 0 to the huge size # 5 .
These shutters are very reliable and relatively easy to repair .. Wollensak purchased the Fastax high speed rotating-prism camera developed by Bell Labs from Western Electric , and developed it to a capability of 10,000 frame/s .
Fastax cameras were used for recording projectiles and explosions , including nuclear explosions .
The cameras , with the rotating prism removed , were often used for `` streak '' and `` smear '' photography .
See high speed photography .. Wollensak only ever made one still camera , the `` Stereo 10 '' 35 mm 3D Camera .. They also made some shutters and formed a partnership with The Revere Camera Company that led to them offering some cameras ( mostly 8 mm ) under their name in the 1950s and early 1960s .. 3M also used the Wollensak brand name on audio tape recorders for many years ; the Wollensak recorders were solidly built with all-metal construction .
They were among the first manufacturers of cassette decks , as well as 8-track decks for home use ..

North Melbourne Giants.The North Melbourne Giants , previously known as the Coburg Giants , were an Australian professional basketball team based in Melbourne .
The Giants competed in the National Basketball League ( NBL ) between 1980 and 1998 , and played their home games at The Glass House .. The Coburg Giants entered the league in its second season ( 1980 ) and would change their name to the North Melbourne Giants in 1987 .
Under its new name , the Giants had much success , winning two championships , only to dissolve in 1998 to ultimately become a domestic association ..
Ted Cooper.Edward Theodore `` Ted '' Cooper ( November 11 , 1920 – December 5 , 1999 ) was a long-time United States television scenic designer and creative consultant .
Cooper is best known as the production designer and creative consultant for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions , the leading producer of American TV game shows .
He joined the firm in 1960 and was associated with it until his death at age 79 .. Cooper was hired as a TV art director for NBC in 1950 where he worked on various shows , including `` Your Show of Shows '' , the `` Martin and Lewis Show '' ( until it moved to Los Angeles ) , `` The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show '' , `` The Jimmy Durante Show '' and the game shows `` Haggis Baggis '' and `` Charge Account '' , among others .
Through his association with NBC he knew Fred Rogers of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood fame and contributed to the first version of that show .
He was also responsible for the sets for the 1956 Orson Welles Broadway production of King Lear which lasted for only 21 performances .. Cooper 's best-known achievements were in creating set designs and game displays for TV quiz shows .
He is credited with being the motivating force behind taking game shows from a simple table set in front of a drape to a full set designed for the show .
The Goodson-Todman shows for which Cooper served as art director or creative consultant after 1960 include `` The Price Is Right '' , `` The Match Game '' ( including `` The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour '' ) , `` What 's My Line ?
`` , `` I 've Got a Secret '' , `` To Tell the Truth '' , `` He Said , She Said '' ( and its successor `` Tattletales '' ) , `` Family Feud '' , `` Beat the Clock '' , `` Password '' ( and its revivals `` Password Plus '' and `` Super Password '' ) , `` Say When ! !
`` , the Jack Narz and Alex Trebek revivals of `` Concentration '' , `` Double Dare '' , `` Card Sharks '' , `` Mindreaders '' , `` The Better Sex '' , `` Now You See It '' , `` Blockbusters '' , `` Child 's Play '' , `` Body Language '' , and `` Trivia Trap '' , as well as assorted pilots .
In addition to being the scenic designer of `` Say When ! !
`` , he was also the associate producer of that show .
Cooper 's design for `` Say When '' was among the first uses of alpha-numeric electronic readouts on TV and in the U.S. , and helped the Split-flap display to become so popular for a time on TV and in other venues .
Cooper 's designs typically included technology not only for displaying numbers and letters , but also technology for controlling electromechanical devices such as lights and sound effects .
Most of his designs were executed without the benefit of computer-generated special effects for which the industry is known today , but one of his shows , `` Classic Concentration '' , was one of the earliest shows to implement its game board on a fully computerized display .
Many of his sets utilized rotating elements : `` Family Feud '' , `` Match Game '' , `` Card Sharks '' and `` The Price Is Right '' with its well-known turntable .
Game show producer Dan Enright , whose shows competed with those of Goodson-Todman , once referred to Cooper as `` Mark Goodson 's secret weapon '' .. For the 1958 Barry and Enright game show `` Concentration '' , which aired on NBC for 15 years before moving into syndication , he created the display that showed the list of prizes as the contestants matched them .
The display did not show a stagehand slipping in the name of the prize on the side , but rather had the prize name in place obscured by a sliding front cover which would then be pulled to the side to reveal the prize name .
For the syndicated version of `` Concentration '' , Cooper devised the `` Head Start '' feature in which four prizes were revealed prior to the start of the game .
The prizes revealed were `` fee items '' for which the producers received a fee for being plugged on the show .
`` Head Start '' guaranteed that the copy for those fee items was read and the fee collected regardless of whether or not the prizes were won during the game .
For the 1972 version of `` The Price Is Right '' Cooper created the pricing games Any Number and Range Game .
The physical game devices and other set pieces used on that version of the show prior to 2000 were designed by Cooper himself or under his supervision .. Cooper designed the psychedelic set for the 1969 syndicated revival of `` To Tell the Truth '' .
The brightly colored panels and elegant lettering he supervised for the show 's set in the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York gave a modern , youthful feel to a show that had already been a success for 12 years on CBS .. Cooper was a gold card member of IATSE Local 829 , the United Scenic Artists , and for several years until his retirement was the oldest working member of that union ....
Matthew Flinders.Captain Matthew Flinders ( 16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814 ) was an English navigator and cartographer who led the second circumnavigation of New Holland that he would subsequently call `` Australia or Terra Australis '' and identified it as a continent .
Abel Tasman had circumnavigated it more widely in 1642–43 and had charted its north coast in 1644 .. Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810 .
In the second voyage , George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen 's Land ( now Tasmania ) was an island .
In the third voyage , Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia .. Heading back to England in 1803 , Flinders ' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France ( Mauritius ) .
Although Britain and France were at war , Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage , but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years .
In captivity , he recorded details of his voyages for future publication , and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia ' , as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie .. Flinders ' health had suffered , however , and although he reached home in 1810 , he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas , `` A Voyage to Terra Australis '' .
The location of his grave was lost by the mid-19th century but archaeologists excavating a former burial ground near London 's Euston railway station for the High Speed 2 ( HS2 ) project , announced in January 2019 that his remains had been identified .. Matthew Flinders was born in Donington , Lincolnshire , England , the son of Matthew Flinders , a surgeon , and his wife Susannah , née Ward .
He was educated at Cowley 's Charity School , Donington , from 1780 and then at the Reverend John Shinglar 's Grammar School at Horbling in Lincolnshire .. In his own words , he was `` induced to go to sea against the wishes of my friends from reading `` Robinson Crusoe '' '' , and in 1789 , at the age of fifteen , he joined the Royal Navy .
Initially serving on , he transferred to , and in July 1790 was made midshipman on under Captain Pasley .
By Pasley 's recommendation , he joined Captain Bligh 's expedition on , transporting breadfruit from Tahiti to Jamaica .
This was also Bligh 's second `` Breadfruit Voyage '' following on from the ill-fated voyage of the `` Bounty '' .. Flinders ' first voyage to New South Wales , and first trip to Port Jackson , was in 1795 as a midshipman aboard , carrying the newly appointed governor of New South Wales Captain John Hunter .
The passage between the Australian mainland and Tasmania enabled savings of several days on the journey from England , and was named Bass Strait , after his close friend .
In honour of this discovery , the largest island in Bass Strait would later be named Flinders Island .
The town of Flinders near the mouth of Western Port also commemorates Bass ' discovery of that bay and port on 4 January 1798 .
Flinders never entered Western Port , and passed Cape Schanck only on 3 May 1802 .. Flinders once more sailed `` Norfolk '' , this time north on 17 July 1799 ; he arrived in Moreton Bay between modern-day Redcliffe and Brighton .
He rowed ashore at Woody Point ( ) and named a point west of that ( ) as `` Redcliffe '' ( on account of its red cliffs ) .
That point is now known as Clontarf Point , while the name `` Redcliffe '' is used by the town of Redcliffe to the north .
He landed on Coochiemudlo Island ( ) on 19 July 1799 while he was searching for a river in the southern part of Moreton Bay .
In the northern part of Moreton bay , he explored a narrow waterway ( ) which he named the Pumice Stone River ( presumably unaware it separated Bribie Island and the mainland ) ; it is now called the Pumicestone Passage .
In doing so , he established that Fraser Island was not a peninsula ( as was then believed ) but an island .
However , he failed to find a navigable channel through the Great Sandy Strait which separates the island from the mainland .
It was not until 10 November 1846 that the strait was successfully navigated by Lieutenant Joseph Dayman in a small decked boat called the `` Asp '' .. In March 1800 , Flinders rejoined `` Reliance '' and set sail for England .. Flinders ' work had come to the attention of many of the scientists of the day , in particular the influential Sir Joseph Banks , to whom Flinders dedicated his `` Observations on the Coasts of Van Diemen 's Land , on Bass 's Strait , etc . `` .
Banks used his influence with Earl Spencer to convince the Admiralty of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland .
As a result , in January 1801 , Flinders was given command of , a 334-ton sloop , and promoted to commander the following month .. '' Investigator '' set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801 .
Attached to the expedition were the botanist Robert Brown , botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer , landscape artist William Westall , gardener Peter Good , geological assistant John Allen , and John Crosley as astronomer .
comment that compared to the Baudin expedition this was a 'modest contingent of scientific gentlemen ' , which reflects 'British parsimony ' in scientific endeavour .. On 17 April 1801 , Flinders married his longtime friend Ann Chappelle ( 1772–1852 ) and had hoped to take her with him to Port Jackson .
However , the Admiralty had strict rules against wives accompanying captains .
Flinders brought Ann on board ship and planned to ignore the rules , but the Admiralty learned of his plans and reprimanded him for his bad judgement , and ordered him to remove her from the ship .
This is well documented in correspondence between Flinders and his chief benefactor , Sir Joseph Banks , in May 1801 : .As a result , Ann was obliged to stay in England and would not see her husband for nine years , following his imprisonment on the Isle de France ( Mauritius , at the time a French possession ) on his return journey .
When they finally reunited , Matthew and Ann had one daughter , Anne , ( 1 April 1812 – 1892 ) , who later married William Petrie ( 1821–1908 ) .
In 1853 , the governments of New South Wales and Victoria bequeathed a belated pension to her ( deceased ) mother of £100 per year , to go to surviving issue of the union .
This she accepted on behalf of her young son , William Matthew Flinders Petrie , who would go on to become an accomplished archaeologist and Egyptologist .. Aboard `` Investigator '' , Flinders reached and named Cape Leeuwin on 6 December 1801 , and proceeded to make a survey along the southern coast of the Australian mainland .
On his way he stopped in at Oyster Harbour , Western Australia .
There he found a copper plate that Captain Christopher Dixson , on , had left the year before .
Chr Dixson , ship Elligood '' .. On 8 April 1802 , while sailing east , Flinders sighted , a French corvette commanded by the explorer Nicolas Baudin , who was on a similar expedition for his government .
Both men of science , Flinders and Baudin met and exchanged details of their discoveries , despite believing that their countries were at war ; Flinders named the bay Encounter Bay .. Proceeding along the coast , Flinders explored Port Phillip ( the site of the future city of Melbourne ) , which , unknown to him , had been discovered only ten weeks earlier by John Murray aboard .
Flinders scaled Arthur 's Seat , the highest point near the shores of the southernmost parts of the bay , where the ship had entered through The Heads .
From there he saw a vast view of the surrounding land and bays .
Flinders reported back to Governor King that the land had `` a pleasing and , in many parts , a fertile appearance '' .
After scaling the You Yangs to the northwest on 1 May , he stated `` I left the ship 's name on a scroll of paper , deposited in a small pile of stones upon the top of the peak '' .
Here , Flinders was drawing upon a British tradition of constructing a stone cairn to mark a historical location .. The Matthew Flinders Cairn , which was later enlarged , is located on the upper slopes of Arthur 's Seat , a short distance below Chapman 's Point .. With stores running low , Flinders proceeded to Sydney , arriving on 9 May 1802 .
Here he was rejoined by Bungaree , the Aboriginal man who had accompanied him on his earlier coastal survey in 1799 .. Having hastily prepared the ship , Flinders set sail again on 22 July , heading north and surveying the coast of Queensland .
From there he passed through the Torres Strait , and explored the Gulf of Carpentaria .
During this time , the ship was discovered to be badly leaking , and despite careening , they were unable to effect the necessary repairs .
Reluctantly , Flinders returned to Sydney , though via the western coast , completing the circumnavigation of the continent .
On the way , Flinders jettisoned two wrought-iron anchors which were found by divers in 1973 at Middle Island , Recherche Archipelago , Western Australia .
The best bower anchor is on display at the South Australian Maritime Museum while the stream anchor can be seen at the National Museum of Australia .. Arriving in Sydney on 9 June 1803 , `` Investigator '' was subsequently judged to be unseaworthy and condemned .. While not formally trained in natural philosophy ( now termed physics ) , Flinders coined the term `` dodge tide '' in reference to his 1802/3 observations that the tides in the very shallow Spencer and St Vincent 's Gulfs seemed to be completely inert for several days , at select locations .
Such phenomena have now also been found in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Irish Sea .
In both the Irish Sea and the two South Australian gulfs , a north bound wave from the open ocean interferes non-linearly and with a reflected and weaker southbound wave , resulting in aperiodic and very dissipative tidal motions .. In his 1803 observations of the large tides at Broad Sound in Queensland ( up to 11m range ) Flinders correctly attributed this to two waves travelling north and south , respectively , and meeting at Broad Sound .
He postulated that the dense reef wall further offshore caused the deep ocean tide to bifurcate at the northern southern ends of the reef , travel into shallow shelf waters and meet at Broad Sound .
These phenomena were finally confirmed by G. I. Taylor in his landmark 1919 Irish Sea analysis .. Unable to find another vessel suitable to continue his exploration , Flinders set sail for England as a passenger aboard .
However , the ship was wrecked on Wreck Reefs , part of the Great Barrier Reef , approximately north of Sydney .
Flinders navigated the ship 's cutter across open sea back to Sydney , and arranged for the rescue of the remaining marooned crew .
Despite this , and the knowledge of Baudin 's earlier encounter with Flinders , the French governor , Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen , detained Flinders .
The relationship between the men soured : Flinders was affronted at his treatment , and Decaen insulted by Flinders ' refusal of an invitation to dine with him and his wife .
Decaen was suspicious of the alleged scientific mission as the Cumberland carried no scientists and Decaen 's search of Flinders ' vessel uncovered a trunk full of papers ( including despatches from the New South Wales Governor Philip Gidley King ) that were not permitted under his scientific passport .
Furthermore , one of King 's despatches was specifically to the British Admiralty requesting more troops in case Decaen were to attack Port Jackson .
Among the papers seized were the three logs of of which only Volume one and Volume two were returned to Flinders ; these are now both held by the State Library of New South Wales .
The third volume was later deposited in the Admiralty Library and is now held in the British Public Record Office .
Decaen referred the matter to the French government ; this was delayed not only by the long voyage but also by the general confusion of war .
Eventually , on 11 March 1806 , Napoleon gave his approval , but Decaen still refused to allow Flinders ' release .
By this stage Decaen believed Flinders ' knowledge of the island 's defences would have encouraged Britain to attempt to capture it .
Nevertheless , in June 1809 the Royal Navy began a blockade of the island , and in June 1810 Flinders was paroled .
Travelling via the Cape of Good Hope on , which was taking despatches back to Britain , he received a promotion to post-captain , before continuing to England .. Flinders had been confined for the first few months of his captivity , but he was later afforded greater freedom to move around the island and access his papers .
In November 1804 he sent the first map of the landmass he had charted ( Y46/1 ) back to England .
This was the only map made by Flinders where he used the name `` Australia or Terra Australis '' for the title instead of New Holland the name of the continent that James Cook had used in 1770 and Abel Tasman had coined a Dutch version of in 1644 , and the first known time he used the word Australia .
He used the name New Holland on his map only for the western part of the continent .
Due to the delay caused by his lengthy confinement , the first published map of the Australian continent was the Freycinet Map of 1811 , a product of the Baudin expedition , issued in 1811 .. Flinders finally returned to England in October 1810 .
He was in poor health but immediately resumed work preparing `` A Voyage to Terra Australis '' and his atlas of maps for publication .
The full title of this book , which was first published in London in July 1814 , was given , as was common at the time , a synoptic description : `` A Voyage to Terra Australis : undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country , and prosecuted in the years 1801 , 1802 , and 1803 in His Majesty 's ship the '' Investigator , `` and subsequently in the armed vessel '' Porpoise `` and '' Cumberland Schooner .
`` With an account of the shipwreck of the `` Porpoise '' , arrival of the `` Cumberland '' at Mauritius , and imprisonment of the commander during six years and a half in that island '' .
Original copies of the `` Atlas to Flinders ' Voyage to Terra Australis '' are held at the Mitchell Library in Sydney as a portfolio that accompanied the book and included engravings of 16 maps , four plates of views and ten plates of Australian flora .
The book was republished in three volumes in 1964 , accompanied by a reproduction of the portfolio .
Flinders ' map of `` Terra Australis or Australia '' ( so the two parts of the double name of his 1804 manuscript reversed ) was first published in January 1814 and the remaining maps were published before his atlas and book .. Flinders died , aged 40 , on 19 July 1814 from kidney disease , at his London home at 14 London Street , later renamed Maple Street and now the site of the BT Tower .
This was on the day after the book and atlas was published ; Flinders never saw the completed work as he was unconscious by that time , but his wife arranged the volumes on his bed covers so that he could touch them .
On 23 July he was interred in the burial ground of St James 's Church , Piccadilly , which was located some distance from the church , beside Hampstead Road , Camden , London .
The burial ground was in use from 1790 until 1853 .
By 1852 the location of the grave had been forgotten due to alterations to the burial ground .. In 1878 the cemetery became St James 's Gardens , Camden , with only a few gravestones lining the edges of the park .
Part of the gardens , located between Hampstead Road and Euston railway station , was built over when Euston station was expanded , and Flinders ' grave was thought to possibly lie under a station platform .
The Gardens were closed to the public in 2017 for work on the High Speed 2 ( HS2 ) rail project which requires the expansion of Euston station .. The grave was located in January 2019 by archaeologists .
His coffin was identified by its well-preserved lead coffin plate .
It is proposed to re-bury his remains , at a site to be decided , after they have been examined by osteo-archaeologists .. Following the discovery of his grave the parish church of Donington , Lincolnshire , Flinders ' birthplace , saw a surge of visitors .
The 'Matthew Flinders Bring Him Home Group ' , which includes local and county representatives and the Britain-Australia Society , as well as Flinders ' direct descendants .
campaigned to have his remains interred at the church .
On 17 October 2019 HS2 Ltd announced that Flinders remains will be reinterred in the parish Church of St Mary and the Holy Rood in Donington , where he was baptised .
The Diocese of Lincoln has given planning consent for the reburial .. Flinders ' map Y46/1 was never `` lost '' .
It had been stored and recorded by the UK Hydrographic Office before 1828 .
Geoffrey C. Ingleton mentioned Y46/1 in his book `` Matthew Flinders Navigator and Chartmaker '' on page 438 .
By 1987 every library in Australia had access to a microfiche copy of Flinders Y46/1 .
In 2001–2002 the Mitchell Library Sydney displayed Y46/1 at their `` Matthew Flinders – The Ultimate Voyage '' exhibition .
Paul Brunton called Y46/1 `` the memorial of the great naval explorer Matthew Flinders '' .
The first hard-copy of Y46/1 and its cartouche was retrieved from the UK Hydrographic Office ( Taunton , Somerset ) by historian Bill Fairbanks in 2004 .
On 2 April 2004 , copies of the chart were presented by three of Matthew Flinders 's descendants to the Governor of New South Wales , in London , to be presented in turn to the people of Australia through their parliaments by 14 November , the 200th anniversary of the chart leaving Mauritius .
This celebration marked the first time the naming of Australia was formally recognised .. Flinders was not the first to use the word `` Australia '' , nor was he the first to apply the name specifically to the continent .
He owned a copy of Alexander Dalrymple 's 1771 book `` An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean '' , and it seems likely he borrowed it from there , but he applied it specifically to the continent , not the whole South Pacific region .
In 1804 he wrote to his brother : `` I call the whole island Australia , or Terra Australis '' .
Later that year , he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks and mentioned `` my general chart of Australia '' , a map that Flinders had constructed from all the information he had accumulated while he was in Australian waters and finished while he was detained by the French in Mauritius .
Flinders explained in his letter to Banks : .Flinders continued to promote the use of the word until his arrival in London in 1810 .
Here he found that Banks did not approve of the name and had not unpacked the chart he had sent him , and that `` New Holland '' and `` Terra Australis '' were still in general use .
As a result , a book by Flinders was published under the title `` A Voyage to Terra Australis '' and his published map of 1814 also shows 'Terra Australis ' as the first of the two name options , despite his objections .
The final proofs were brought to him on his deathbed , but he was unconscious .
Banks said in the draft : .Although Thévenot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall , in fact it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of Joan Blaeu in his `` Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus '' published in 1659 .
Lachlan Macquarie , Governor of New South Wales , became aware of Flinders ' preference for the name Australia and used it in his dispatches to England .
On 12 December 1817 , he recommended to the Colonial Office that it be officially adopted .
In 1824 the British Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia .. Although he never used his own name for any feature in all his discoveries , Flinders ' name is now associated with over 100 geographical features and places in Australia , including Flinders Island in Bass Strait , but not Flinders Island in South Australia , which he named for his younger brother , Samuel Flinders .. Flinders is seen as being particularly important in South Australia , where he is considered the main explorer of the state .
Landmarks named after him in South Australia include the Flinders Ranges and Flinders Ranges National Park , Flinders Column at Mount Lofty , Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo Island , Flinders University , Flinders Medical Centre , the suburb Flinders Park and Flinders Street in Adelaide .
In Victoria , eponymous places include Flinders Peak , Flinders Street in Melbourne , the suburb of Flinders , the federal electorate of Flinders , and the Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College in Geelong .. Flinders Bay in Western Australia and Flinders Way in Canberra also commemorate him .
Educational institutions named after him include Flinders Park Primary School on South Australia , and Matthew Flinders Anglican College on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland .
A former electoral district of the Queensland Parliament was named Flinders .
There are also Flinders Highways in both Queensland and South Australia .. Bass & Flinders Point in the southernmost part of Cronulla in New South Wales features a monument to George Bass and Matthew Flinders , who explored the Port Hacking estuary .. Australia holds a large collection of statues erected in Flinders ' honour .
In his native England , the first statue of Flinders was erected on 16 March 2006 ( his birthday ) in his hometown of Donington .
The statue also depicts his beloved cat Trim , who accompanied him on his voyages .
Named by `` Investigator '' s botanist , Robert Brown in honour of Matthew Flinders .. Flinders landed on Coochiemudlo Island on 19 July 1799 , while he was searching for a river in the southern part of Moreton Bay , Queensland , Australia .
The island 's residents celebrate Flinders Day annually , commemorating the landing .
The celebrations are usually held on a weekend near 19 July , the actual date of the landing .. Flinder 's explorations of the Hervey Bay area are commemorated by a monument called Matthew Flinders Lookout at the top of an escarpment facing the bay in Dayman Park , Urangan ( ) ...
Star Wars Arcade.Star Wars Arcade ( also known as Star Wars ) is a video game developed by Sega and released in 1993 in Japan and USA and 1994 in Europe to arcades .
A home port served as a launch title for the Sega 32X in 1994 .
It is set during the original `` Star Wars '' trilogy .. Gameplay is similar to that of Atari 's 1983 `` Star Wars '' arcade game .
Players pilot an X-wing or a Y-wing in first or third person perspective and battle Imperial forces .. The game has three levels which include intercepting TIE fighters in an asteroid field , destroying a Super Star Destroyer , and making an assault run on a Death Star .
The arcade cabinet allows two people to play , with one serving as pilot and the other as gunner .. Sega followed this with the release of `` Star Wars Trilogy Arcade '' in 1998 .. '' Electronic Gaming Monthly '' scored the 32X version at 6.25/10 , describing it as a decent but disappointing launch title for the console .
They cited excellent graphics but repetitive gameplay and complained about the limited movement .
`` GamePro '' similarly assessed that the game is a decent demonstration of the 32X 's graphical capabilities but suffers from repetitive gameplay .
They also criticized that the controls are convoluted when using a standard three-button gamepad and that in cooperative mode the second player 's cursor is difficult to see against certain backgrounds .
`` Next Generation '' rated the 32X version of the game at three stars out of five , calling it `` An excellent translation of a good game , and a good hint of what to expect from 32X .

P16.p16 ( also known as p16 , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A , CDKN2A , multiple tumor suppressor 1 and numerous other synonyms ) , is a protein that slows cell division by slowing the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase , thereby acting as a tumor suppressor .
It is encoded by the `` CDKN2A '' gene .
A deletion ( the omission of a part of the DNA sequence during replication ) in this gene can result in insufficient or non-functional p16 , accelerating the cell cycle and resulting in many types of cancer .. p16 can be used as a biomarker to improve the histological diagnostic accuracy of grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) .
p16 is also implicated in the prevention of melanoma , oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma , cervical cancer , and esophageal cancer .. p16 was discovered in 1993 .
It is a protein with 148 amino acids and a molecular weight of 16 kDa that comprises four ankyrin repeats .
The name of p16 is derived from its molecular weight , and the alternative name p16 refers to its role in inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDK4 .. p16 is also known as : .In humans , p16 is encoded by the CDKN2A gene , located on chromosome 9 ( 9p21.3 ) .
This gene generates several transcript variants that differ in their first exons .
At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported , two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 .
The remaining transcript includes an alternate exon 1 located 20 kb upstream of the remainder of the gene ; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame ( ARF ) that specifies a protein that is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants .
The ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 , as it can interact with and sequester MDM2 , a protein responsible for the degradation of p53 .
In spite of their structural and functional differences , the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene , through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression , share a common functionality in controlling the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene .. When organisms age , the expression of p16 increases to reduce the proliferation of stem cells .
This reduction in the division and production of stem cells protects against cancer while increasing the risks associated with cellular senescence .. p16 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK ) .
It slows down the cell cycle by prohibiting progression from G1 phase to S phase .
Otherwise , CDK4/6 binds cyclin D and forms an active protein complex that phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) .
Once phosphorylated , pRB dissociates from the transcription factor E2F1 .
This liberates E2F1 from its bound state in the cytoplasm and allows it to enter the nucleus .
Once in the nucleus , E2F1 promotes the transcription of target genes that are essential for transition from G1 to S phase .. This pathway connects the processes of tumor oncogenesis and senescence , fixing them on opposite ends of a spectrum .
On one end , p16 hypermethylation , mutation , or deletion leads to downregulation of the gene and can lead to cancer through the dysregulation of cell cycle progression .
Conversely , activation of p16 through reactive oxygen species , DNA damage , or senescence leads to the buildup of p16 in tissues and is implicated in the aging of cells .. Regulation of p16 is complex and involves the interaction of several transcription factors , as well as several proteins involved in epigenetic modification through methylation and repression of the promoter region .. PRC1 and PRC2 are two protein complexes that modify the expression of p16 through the interaction of various transcription factors that execute methylation patterns that can repress transcription of p16 .
These pathways are activated in the cellular response to reduce senescence .. Mutations resulting in deletion or reduction of function of the CDKN2A gene are associated with increased risk of a wide range of cancers , and alterations of the gene are frequently seen in cancer cell lines .
Examples include : .Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often associated with mutations in the CDKN2A gene .. Carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A have , besides their high risks of melanoma , also increased risks of pancreatic , lung , laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers .
Tobacco smoking increases the carriers ’ susceptibility for such non-melanoma cancers .. Homozygous deletions of p16 are frequently found in esophageal cancer and gastric cancer cell lines .. Germline mutations in CDKN2A are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop skin cancer .. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in various cancers .
In 2013 , a meta-analysis revealed an increased frequency of DNA methylation of the p16 gene in esophageal cancer .
As the degree of tumor differentiation increased , so did the frequency of p16 DNA methylation .. Tissue samples of primary oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) often display hypermethylation in the promoter regions of p16 .
Cancer cells show a significant increase in the accumulation of methylation in CpG islands in the promoter region of p16 .
This epigenetic change leads to loss of the tumor suppressor gene function through two possible mechanisms : first , methylation can physically inhibit the transcription of the gene , and second , methylation can lead to the recruitment of transcription factors that repress transcription .
Both mechanisms cause the same end result : downregulation of gene expression that leads to decreased levels of the p16 protein .
It has been suggested that this process is responsible for the development of various forms of cancer serving as an alternative process to gene deletion or mutation .. p16 positivity has been shown to be favorably prognostic in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma .
In a retrospective trial analysis of patients with Stage III and IV oropharyngeal cancer , HPV status was assessed and it was found that the 3-year rates of overall survival were 82.4 % ( 95 % CI , 77.2 to 87.6 ) in the HPV-positive subgroup and 57.1 % ( 95 % CI , 48.1 to 66.1 ) in the HPV-negative subgroup , and the 3-year rates of progression-free survival were 73.7 % ( 95 % CI , 67.7 to 79.8 ) and 43.4 % ( 95 % CI , 34.4 to 52.4 ) , respectively .
p16 status is so prognostic that the AJCC staging system has been revised to include p16 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer group staging .. Expression of p16 is used as a prognostic biomarker for certain types of cancer .
The reason for this is different types of cancer can have different effects on p16 expression : cancers that overexpress p16 are usually caused by the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , whereas cancers in which p16 is downregulated will usually have other causes .
For patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma , using immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of the p16 biomarker has been shown to be the strongest indicator of disease course .
Presence of the biomarker is associated with a more favorable prognosis as measured by cancer-specific survival ( CSS ) , recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) , locoregional control ( LRC ) , as well as other measurements .
The appearance of hypermethylation of p16 is also being evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer .. p16 deletion detected by FISH in surface epithelial mesothelial proliferations is predictive of underlying invasive mesothelioma .. As consensus grows regarding the strength of p16 as a biomarker for detecting and determining prognoses of cancer , p16 immunohistochemistry is growing in importance .. p16 is a widely used immunohistochemical marker in gynecologic pathology .
Strong and diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of p16 in squamous cell carcinomas ( SCC ) of the female genital tract is strongly associated with high-risk human papilloma virus ( HPV ) infection and neoplasms of cervical origin .
The majority of SCCs of uterine cervix express p16 .
However , p16 can be expressed in other neoplasms and in several normal human tissues .. More than a third of urinary bladder SCCs express p16 .
SCCs of urinary bladder express p16 independent of gender .
p16 immunohistochemical expression alone can not be used to discriminate between SCCs arising from uterine cervix versus urinary bladder .. Concentrations of p16INK4a increase dramatically as tissue ages .
p16INK4a , along with senescence-associated beta-galactosidase , is regarded to be a biomarker of cellular senescence .
Therefore , p16INK4a could potentially be used as a blood test that measures how fast the body 's tissues are aging at a molecular level .
Notably , a recent survey of cellular senescence induced by multiple treatments to several cell lines does not identify p16 as belonging to a `` core signature '' of senescence markers .. It has been used as a target to delay some aging changes in mice .. p16INK4a has been shown to prevent the depletion during aging of neural stem and progenitor cells in one of the neurogenic niche of the adult brain , i.e , the subventricular zone , which generates throughout life new neurons migrating to the olfactory bulb .
Deletion of p16INK4a does not affect neurogenesis in the other adult neurogenic niche , the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus .
However , recently , it has been demonstrated that p16INK4a protects from depletion after a powerful proneurogenic stimulus - i.e. , running - also stem and progenitor cells of the aged dentate gyrus .
In fact , after deletion of p16INK4a , stem cells of the dentate gyrus are greatly activated by running , while , in wild-type p16INK4a dentate gyrus stem cells are not affected by running .
Therefore , p16Ink4a plays a role in the maintenance of dentate gyrus stem cells after stimulus , by keeping a reserve of their self-renewal capacity during aging .
Since the dentate gyrus plays a key role in spatial and contextual memory formation , p16INK4a is implicated in the maintenance of cognitive functions during aging .. Researchers Manuel Serrano , Gregory J. Hannon and David Beach discovered p16 in 1993 and correctly characterized the protein as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor .
.Since its discovery , p16 has become significant in the field of cancer research .
The protein was suspected to be involved in carcinogenesis due to the observation that mutation or deletion in the gene was implicated in human cancer cell lines .
The detection of p16 inactivation in familial melanoma supplied further evidence .
p16 deletion , mutation , hypermethylation , or overexpression is now associated with various cancers .
Whether mutations in p16 can be considered to be driver mutations requires further investigation .. p16 has been shown to interact with : ..

McNulty.McNulty ( ) is an ancient Gaelic-Irish surname , meaning `` son of the Ulsterman '' .
Usually considered a branch of the Ulaid ruling dynasty of `` Mac Duinnshléibhe '' ( MacDonlevy ) who fled Ulaid to Ailech after the former 's conquest in 1177 by the Normans , DNA analysis points to descent from other Ulaid families as well .
After the Battle of Kinsale in 1602 , some McDonlevys and McNultys migrated to the province of Connacht where their name is now common .. The name is said to have arisen from a branch of the ruling Ulaid dynasty of `` Mac Duinnshléibhe '' ( MacDonlevy ) who had migrated to what is now County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland after John de Courcy 's conquest of Ulaid in 1177 .
Here some of the MacDonlevys were nicknamed `` Ultagh/Ultach '' .
However , historical records such as the 1659 `` Census '' as well as Griffith 's Valuation ( 1848-1864 ) show that concentrations of McNultys were found in parts of Ireland where the MacDonlevys had little presence , coupled with DNA analysis showing that the McNultys may actually derive from other Gaelic families that migrated from Ulaid and not just the MacDonlevy 's .
The surname prefix `` m'Nich '' appears to be an English confusion of the female prefix `` Nic '' with the male prefix `` Mac '' .. Other variant spellings of McNulty include McNaulty , McNalty , and rarely as O'Nalty , Nolty , McNult , McEnulty and McKnulty .
and others .. In County Clare and its adjacent County Tipperary in the southwest of the Republic of Ireland , the toponymics Connoulty and Kinoulty are encountered , and are believed to be Anglicisations of `` Mac an Ultaigh '' .. By 1980 , there were 19,469 persons surnamed McNulty in the United States Social Security Administration data base .
The surname McNulty was , then , the 2332 most frequently occurring surname in that database .
Some of the first McNulty immigrants to North America arrived in Philadelphia and New York City in the very early 19th century and , later , more numerously , in both Philadelphia and New York City between 1840 and 1860 , during which period the great Irish Potato Famine occurred .. There are an estimated 421 persons surnamed McNulty in Australia .
Denis McInulty , one of the first McNulty to arrive in Australia , arrived there from Scotland on 16 May 1846 on the prisoner transport the `` China '' under a 10-year sentence of the Glasgow Justiciary Court .. In the United Kingdom the surname McNulty is shared by an estimated 7,318 people and is approximately the 1,472th most popular surname in the country ....... Found in a single location on the earth 's surface , that is McNulty Gulch near Leadville Colorado , McNulty rhyolite is a comparatively rare gem rock quality variety of rhyolite rock .
McNulty rhyolite appears in the official U.S. Department of Interior , United States Geological Survey `` Lexicon of Geological Names of the United States '' ...

Xiao Cha.Emperor Xuan of ( Western ) Liang ( ( 西 ) 梁宣帝 ; 519–562 ) , personal name Xiao Cha ( 蕭詧 ) , courtesy name Lisun ( 理孫 ) , was the founding emperor of the Chinese Western Liang dynasty .
He took the Liang throne under support from Western Wei after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed his uncle Emperor Yuan in 554 , but many traditional historians , because he controlled little territory and relied heavily on military support by Western Wei and Western Wei 's successor state Northern Zhou , did not consider him and his successors true emperors of Liang .
Instead , their state is traditionally considered separate , as Western Liang ( or Later Liang ) .. Xiao Cha was born in 519 , as the third son of Xiao Tong , then the crown prince to Liang Dynasty 's founder Emperor Wu .
His mother was Xiao Tong 's concubine Consort Gong .
He was considered studious , concentrating particularly on Buddhist sutras , and as Emperor Wu was a devout Buddhist , he was happy that his grandson studied sutras in this manner .
When Emperor Wu created Xiao Tong 's sons dukes sometime between 520 and 527 , Xiao Cha was created the Duke of Qujiang .. In 531 , Xiao Tong died , but instead of creating Xiao Tong 's oldest son Xiao Huan ( 蕭歡 ) the Duke of Huarong crown prince to succeed him ( as was expected under Confucian principles of succession ) , Emperor Wu created Xiao Tong 's younger brother Xiao Gang crown prince instead .
However , he felt that he did not treat Xiao Tong 's sons fairly , and therefore he created them princes—in Xiao Cha 's case , the Prince of Yueyang—and gave them honors only slightly subordinate to their uncles .
Because the capital commandery of Eastern Yang Province ( 東揚州 , modern central and eastern Zhejiang ) , Kuaiji Commandery ( the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay ) , was the richest commandery of the entire empire , he rotated them as the governor of Eastern Yang Province , and Xiao Cha was thus rotated there sometime before 546 .
However , despite these special treatments , Xiao Cha was still angry that he and his brothers were passed over by Emperor Wu .
( Emperor Wu died later that year and was succeeded by Crown Prince Gang ( as Emperor Jianwen ) , albeit under Hou 's control . )
Meanwhile , also in 548 , Emperor Wu had made Xiao Cha 's older brother Xiao Yu ( 蕭譽 ) the Prince of Hedong the governor of Xiang Province ( 湘州 , modern central Hunan ) , rotating the previous governor of Xiang Province , Zhang Zuan ( 張纘 ) to Yong Province .
Zhang was a close friend of Emperor Wu 's powerful son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong , who was then the governor of the key Jing Province ( 荊州 , modern western and central Hubei ) , and he did not take Xiao Yu seriously , making Xiao Yu felt disrespected .
Xiao Yu therefore detained Zhang and did not permit him to leave .
Further , when Xiao Yi called for the provincial governors in his command region ( which , inter alia , included both Xiang and Yong Provinces ) to send troops to help lift the siege on Jiankang , Xiao Yu refused , and while Xiao Cha sent a detachment , he refused to command the detachment personally .
When Zhang fled from Xiao Yu 's custody late in 548 , then , he went to Xiao Yi , and , bearing grudges against Xiao Yu , falsely accused Xiao Yu , Xiao Cha , and their cousin Xiao Cao ( 蕭慥 ) the Prince of Guiyang and governor of Xin Province ( 信州 , modern eastern Chongqing ) of conspiring against Xiao Yi .
Xiao Yi therefore killed Xiao Cao and prepared an army to attack Xiao Yu .. Xiao Yu was initially able to repel Xiao Yi 's attack and cause Xiao Yi 's heir apparent Xiao Fangdeng ( 蕭方等 ) to die in battle in summer 549 , but by fall 549 , he had been defeated by Xiao Yi 's general Bao Quan ( 鮑泉 ) , who put Xiao Yu 's headquarters at Changsha ( 長沙 , in modern Changsha , Hunan ) under siege .
Xiao Yu requested aid from Xiao Cha , and Xiao Cha commanded an army to attack Xiao Yi 's headquarters at Jiangling .
He put Jiangling under siege , but his attack was affected by heavy rains and repelled by Xiao Yi 's general Wang Sengbian , and when his own general Du Ze ( 杜崱 ) surrendered to Xiao Yi , and Du Ze 's brother Du An ( 杜岸 ) further launched a surprise attack on Xiao Cha 's headquarters at Xiangyang ( 襄陽 , in modern Xiangfan , Hubei ) , Xiao Cha was forced to withdraw back to Xiangyang .
Unable to help his brother and fearing that he would become Xiao Yi 's next target—indeed , Xiao Yi then sent the general Liu Zhongli ( 柳仲禮 ) to attack Xiao Cha—Xiao Cha submitted to Western Wei , offering to become a vassal , and sought aid , sending his wife Princess Wang and his heir apparent Xiao Liao ( 蕭嶚 ) to Western Wei as hostages .
Yuwen Tai , the paramount general of Western Wei , accepted Xiao Cha 's submission and sent the general Yang Zhong ( 楊忠 ) to aid Xiao Cha , and Yang defeated and captured Liu in spring 550 .
Yang subsequently entered into a treaty with Xiao Yi , putting Xiao Cha under Western Wei 's protection .
Xiao Yi sacked Changsha and executed Xiao Yu in 550 .. In the summer of 550 , Western Wei offered to declare Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang to inherit Emperor Wu 's throne .
Xiao Cha declined , but accepted the lesser title of Prince of Liang and also assumed acting imperial authority .
Later that year , made a trip to the Western Wei capital Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wen of Western Wei and Yuwen .
In spring 551 , when his uncle Xiao Guan ( 蕭綸 ) the Prince of Shaoling was captured and killed by Western Wei troops commanded by Yang , Xiao Cha , who respected Xiao Guan , took his body and buried it with honors .
In summer 551 , when he heard that Hou was launching an attack on Xiao Yi 's domain , he sent his general Cai Dabao ( 蔡大寶 ) with an army heading toward Jiangling , claiming to be ready to render assistance , but after Xiao Yi sent a rebuking letter , he ordered Cai to withdraw .. In 552 , after defeating Hou , Xiao Yi declared himself emperor ( as Emperor Yuan ) and set his capital at Jiangling .
Believing himself to be strong , he was arrogant in his dealings with Western Wei , drawing attention from Yuwen , who began to consider invading Liang .
When Xiao Cha became aware of this , he paid additional tribute to Western Wei to try to fan the flame .
Subsequently , in spring 553 , when Emperor Yuan not only made the Western Wei envoy Yuwen Renshu ( 宇文仁恕 ) felt insulted by not treating him with as much respect as the envoy from Northern Qi , but further made demands to Yuwen Tai to return former Liang territory taken by Western Wei , Yuwen Tai decided to invade the Liang .
In winter 553 , Northern Zhou troops , commanded by Yu Jin ( 于謹 ) , arrived at Xiangyang , and Xiao Cha 's forces joined them and continued to advance south toward Jiangling .
Emperor Yuan was caught unprepared , and while he summoned his generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin to come to his aid , Emperor Yuan surrendered before they could arrive .
Xiao Cha took the custody of Emperor Yuan , interrogating and insulting him heavily .
Around the new year 555 , with approval from Western Wei authorities , Xiao Cha put Emperor Yuan to death by suffocating him with a large bag full of dirt .
He also executed Emperor Yuan 's sons who were captured when Jiangling fell .. Western Wei created Xiao Cha Emperor of ( Western ) Liang , and he declared himself as such in spring 555 ( as Emperor Xuan ) .
Western Wei forces transferred Jiangling and the surrounding area to Emperor Xuan , but required him to transfer control of the Xiangyang region in exchange , and further left a military garrison at Jiangling , both to protect Emperor Xuan and to make sure that he would not rebel .
Further , Western Wei troops pillaged Jiangling and took most of the inhabitants and the Liang imperial treasures back to Chang'an .
While Western Wei troops under Yu were still at Jiangling , Emperor Xuan 's subordinate Yin Deyi ( 尹德毅 ) suggested that he make a surprise attack on Yu and slaughter the Western Wei troops , then reassert Liang 's independence .
Emperor Xuan declined , reasoning that Western Wei had protected him greatly and that to turn against Western Wei would be unjust .
He later regretted the decision , but the decision was probably a correct one as the other Liang generals showed no inclination of recognizing him as emperor .
( As whether Emperor Xuan was a `` legitimate '' emperor of Liang was thereafter historically debated , his state is usually referred to by historians as either Western Liang or Later Liang .
) .Emperor Xuan posthumously honored his father Xiao Tong and Xiao Tong 's wife Crown Princess Cai as emperor and empress , and honored his mother Consort Gong as empress dowager .
He created his wife Princess Wang empress , and as his heir apparent Xiao Liao had died by this point , he created Xiao Liao 's younger brother Xiao Kui as crown prince .
He entrusted much of the governmental matters to Cai Dabao and Wang Cao ( 王操 ) , both of whom served him faithfully .
He appeared to have full expectation that he would be able to put additional Liang provinces under his control , but immediately , the Liang generals , including Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin , refused to recognize him .
Wang Lin , who controlled modern Hunan and later parts of modern Hubei , indeed , sent his general Hou Ping ( 侯平 ) to attack Emperor Xuan , and while the attack was unsuccessful , Emperor Xuan was unable to expand his holdings .. Later in 555 , Wang Sengbian declared Emperor Yuan 's cousin Xiao Yuanming emperor .
In fall 555 , after Wang Sengbian was killed by his lieutenant Chen Baxian , Chen deposed Xiao Yuanming and declared Emperor Yuan 's son Xiao Fangzhi emperor ( as Emperor Jing ) .
After Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him in 558 , establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu , Wang Lin declared Emperor Yuan 's grandson Xiao Zhuang emperor , thus maintaining a competing claim for the Liang throne .. In late 558 , with Wang Lin having advanced east to try to attack Chen , Emperor Xuan sent Wang Cao to try to seize the commanderies forming modern Hunan from Xiao Zhuang 's domain , although the scope of success for this action was unclear .
In any case , however , when Hou Tian ( 侯瑱 ) , a general of Chen Baxian 's nephew Emperor Wen of Chen defeated Wang Lin in spring 560 , a combination of Emperor Xuan 's and Northern Zhou troops were able to take the western half of Xiao Zhuang 's territory , and Emperor Xuan assumed control over that territory , albeit requiring Northern Zhou military support .. In fall 560 , Hou Tian continued his advance , intending to take Xiang Province from Emperor Xuan .
Northern Zhou generals Heruo Dun ( 賀若敦 ) and Dugu Sheng ( 獨孤盛 ) led their troops against Hou , and Chen and Northern Zhou troops soon stalemated , and while initially , Hou was unable to make much progress against Heruo and Dugu , soon , problems with food supplies and illnesses caused Northern Zhou troops to be worn down .
Around the new year 561 , Dugu was forced to withdraw , putting Heruo under even greater pressure .
By spring 561 , Yin Liang ( 殷亮 ) , who was defending Changsha , surrendered to Chen .

All-NBL Team.The All-NBL Team is an annual National Basketball League ( NBL ) honour bestowed on the best players in the league following every NBL season .
The team has been selected in every season since the league 's second year in 1980 .. The All-NBL Team is chosen via a voting system involving the head coach , one assistant coach and the team captain of each team .
Voters select their All-NBL First and Second Teams by selecting three 'outside ' players and two 'inside ' players for each team .
Players are then allocated 3 points for being placed into a First Team and 2 points for being placed into a Second Team .
These points are then combined , with the Top 10 players making up the First and Second Teams , allowing for an even spread of three 'outside ' players and two 'inside ' players on each team .. On a few occasions , the league 's Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) has not been named in the All-NBL First Team for that year .
This anomaly is a result of the difference between the voting systems determining the two awards in the past .. Since the 2013–14 season , the All-NBL Team has been composed of two teams , each with five roster spots .
Players are selected with regard to position , allowing for an even spread of three 'outside ' players and two 'inside ' players on each team ..

Xiao Yuanming.Xiao Yuanming ( 蕭淵明 ) ( died 556 ) , courtesy name Jingtong ( 靖通 ) , often known by his pre-ascension title of Marquess of Zhenyang ( 貞陽侯 ) , at times known by his post-removal title Duke of Jian'an ( 建安公 ) , honored Emperor Min ( 閔皇帝 ) by Xiao Zhuang , was briefly an emperor of the Chinese Liang Dynasty .
He was the nephew of the founding emperor Emperor Wu .
In 555 , with Liang in disarray after Western Wei had captured and killed Emperor Yuan , Northern Qi , which had held Xiao Yuanming as an honored captive since 547 , forced the general Wang Sengbian to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor .
Soon , however , Wang 's subordinate Chen Baxian killed Wang and removed Xiao Yuanming from the throne , replacing him with Emperor Yuan 's son Xiao Fangzhi ( Emperor Jing ) .
Xiao Yuanming died the following year .. It is not known when Xiao Yuanming was born .
His father Xiao Yi ( 蕭懿 ) was a major general during late Southern Qi , and of Xiao Yi 's sons , five ( perhaps all ) are known to history .
As Xiao Yi was forced to commit suicide by Southern Qi 's cruel emperor Xiao Baojuan in 500 , Xiao Yuanming could not have been born any later than 501 .. After Xiao Yi 's death , Xiao Yi 's younger brother and Xiao Yuanming 's uncle Xiao Yan rebelled at his post of Xiangyang , seeking to avenge Xiao Yi .
By 502 he put the capital Jiankang under siege , and Xiao Baojuan was killed by his own generals .
Later that year , Xiao Yan seized the throne from Xiao Baojuan 's younger brother Emperor He of Southern Qi , ending Southern Qi and establishing Liang Dynasty ( as Emperor Wu ) .
Emperor Wu was said to love Xiao Yuanming greatly , and he created Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang .. Nothing is known about Xiao Yuanming 's career as an official until 547 , when it was recorded that he was the governor of Yu Province ( 豫州 , modern central Anhui ) .
The people were said to be so impressed by his governance that they made a stone monument commemorating his term of office .
However , it became known later that the artisans who carved the monument were associated with and paid by Xiao Yuanming .
Therefore , it became widely believed that he had encouraged the people to create the monument to praise himself .. In 547 , the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing , in conflict with the regent Gao Cheng , surrendered his domain—13 provinces between the Yellow River and the Huai River—to Liang .
Emperor Wu accepted Hou 's surrender and commissioned an army to aid Hou , to be commanded by Emperor Wu 's grandson Xiao Huili ( 蕭會理 ) the Prince of Nankang .
Xiao Yuanming requested to accompany Xiao Huili , and was made Xiao Huili 's assistant .
However , Xiao Huili was cowardly and arrogant , and he refused to meet his subordinate generals , even Xiao Yuanming .
Xiao Yuanming secretly informed Emperor Wu of this , and Emperor Wu relieved Xiao Huili of his command and put Xiao Yuanming in command .. The Liang army , commanded by Xiao Yuanming , advanced on the Eastern Wei city Pengcheng ( 彭城 , in modern Xuzhou , Jiangsu ) , and Xiao Yuanming camped at Hanshan ( 寒山 ) , in Pengcheng 's vicinity , and built a dam over Si River ( 泗水 ) to use water to attack Pengcheng .
Xiao Yuanming 's lieutenant , the general Yang Kan ( 羊侃 ) , quickly completed the dam , but when Yang advised Xiao Yuanming to attack Pengcheng , Xiao Yuanming hesitated .
Because Xiao Yuanming could not come up with a coordinated strategy , the generals under him began to carry out their own actions , including pillaging the people in the region , and Xiao Yuanming was unable to stop them , save the units directly under his own command .. Late in 547 , the Eastern Wei forces commanded by Murong Shaozong ( 慕容紹宗 ) arrived , and instead of engaging the Eastern Wei forces quickly as Yang suggested , Xiao Yuanming became drunk with wine and allowed Murong 's army to settle in .
When the armies did engage , the Liang forces were initially successful , but Murong 's counterattack caused Liang forces to collapse , and Xiao Yuanming was captured .
However , the people of the region was impressed by his refusal to pillage them , and gave him the epithet `` the righteous prince '' ( 義王 , `` yi wang '' ) .
He was taken to the Eastern Wei capital Yecheng ( 鄴城 , in modern Handan , Hebei ) , where Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei formally received and rebuked him , and then released him , sending him to Gao Cheng 's headquarters at Jinyang ( 晉陽 , in modern Taiyuan , Shanxi ) , where Gao treated him with honor—intending to use Xiao Yuanming as a pawn in negotiations with Liang .
He was given the office of `` sanqi changshi '' ( 散騎常侍 ) -- an honorific office with little responsibilities .. In 552 , Emperor Wu 's son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong defeated Hou and declared himself emperor ( as Emperor Yuan ) , setting his capital at Jiangling ( 江陵 , in modern Jingzhou , Hubei ) rather than the war-devastated Jiankang , but in 554 , Western Wei forces captured Jiangling , capturing and then executing Emperor Yuan .
He wrote Wang , suggesting that Xiao Fangzhi was too young to be emperor and proposing Xiao Yuanming as emperor—and Xiao Yuanming apparently cooperated with Emperor Wenxuan in this attempt , as he wrote a letter to Wang as well .
However , a few quick victories by Northern Qi escort forces , commanded by Emperor Wenxuan 's brother Gao Huan ( 高渙 ) the Prince of Shangdang , made Wang fearful , and he wrote back , agreeing to support Xiao Yuanming as emperor—but extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to create Xiao Fangzhi crown prince .
Wang also allowedly only 1,000 soldiers to accompany Xiao Yuanming south of the Yangtze River .
In summer 555 , Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang , and as he saw the main gate to the palace—Zhuque Gate ( 朱雀門 ) , he cried bitterly , and the Liang officials also cried bitterly .
Pursuant to his promise , he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince .
Wang and Chen continued to be in command of the armed forces .. Xiao Yuanming 's reign did not last long .
In fall 555 , Chen Baxian , displeased with Xiao Yuanming 's ascension—which he had tried to persuade Wang Sengbian not to accept—made a surprise attack on Jiankang from his post at Jingkou ( 京口 , in modern Zhenjiang , Jiangsu ) .
With everyone believing that Chen 's army movement was in response to report that Northern Qi was planning to attack , Jiankang 's defense forces made no effort to resist , and Chen surprised Wang , killing him and seizing power .
Two days after Wang 's death , Xiao Yuanming abdicated and moved out of the palace , returning to his private residence .
Chen made Xiao Fangzhi emperor ( as Emperor Jing ) .. Emperor Jing formally made Xiao Yuanming prime minister and created him the greater title of Duke of Jian'an , although there is no evidence that Xiao Yuanming yielded much actual power .. In light of the coup , Northern Qi launched a major attack on Liang in winter 555 , aided by Liang generals loyal to Wang Sengbian .
The Northern Qi and Liang armies following Chen Baxian 's orders stalemated for months .
In summer 556 , Northern Qi generals invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp for peace negotiations , and Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to the Northern Qi camp .
However , before any negotiations could commence , Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back .
In 558 , Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia ( Emperor Yuan 's grandson ) , who was proclaimed Liang 's emperor by the general Wang Lin following Chen 's seizure of the throne from Emperor Jing earlier that year , honored Xiao Yuanming as Emperor Min—a posthumous name recognized by but rarely used by traditional historians ...
